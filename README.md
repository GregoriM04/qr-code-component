## My process

I first started umdertanding the guidelines given in Frontend Mentor's page, the I organized the corresponding files to begin with the challenge. So, I first wrote the structure of the Html file, then I created the css folder container, and later I began with the style file. Once I finish with the css stylesheet, I check the detaits of every part and made myself to be sure of what I did.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned that in some cases simpler is better; but that does not mean to forget about the details. So, it's important to meet a good balance between simplicity and lushness when designing.
